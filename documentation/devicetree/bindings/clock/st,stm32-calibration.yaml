description: |
  STMicroelectronics's STM32 MPUs embed a clock calibration system for
  internal oscillators whose frequency can be affected by temperature and
  voltage variations:
  * HSI, CSI for STM32MP1 family
  * HSI, MSI for STM32MP2 family
  The clock calibration algorithm is based on the comparison of a timer
  (fed by this oscillator) and a clock that is derived from the HSE clock that
  is considered always accurate.
